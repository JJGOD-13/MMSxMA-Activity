# MMSxMA-Activity
The importable python file that will be used to contain the code that is required to run the MA activity

# How it works

This repository contains mainly the MCarPY file that contains a list of importable functions that you can use in order to control the MA activity car sets. The module is built using the Pymata4 library in order to interface with Arduino UNO.

## Getting Started
 
 **To get started simply copy the following line before your document in VSCode**

```python
from MCarPY import *
```
This will import all the required functions into the current namespace.
